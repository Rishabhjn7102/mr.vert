Hello World!
This repo contains some Python Class Assignments.
These assignments have a background of an algorithm course. 
The textbook used for the course was named "Algorithm Design" by Job Kleinberg and Eva Tardos.
Each assignment has a start date and end date. You may calculate the time alloted for each assignment.
These need not necessarily be coded in Python. You could use other languages.
But personally, I found Python the best suite.

Feel free to share them.
